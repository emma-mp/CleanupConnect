# CleanupConnect
HackMIT 2021 Project

A prevalent issue weâ€™ve noticed in our communities is that litter is everywhere. This litter washes into local waterways, and then into the ocean where it harms marine life. The loose trash negatively affects local soil, ecosystems, and more. Plastic marine debris has been shown to directly impact at least 267 species globally. If we can efficiently concentrate our impact by removing loose litter from the environment and placing it into regulated landfills, we can protect local wildlife, clean watersheds, and make the world a better place to live in.

Cleanup Connect was created to help address this problem! Our website allows our users to quickly report trash in their area, specifying the location, type of trash, and quantity
