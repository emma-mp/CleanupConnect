            <div class="middlePadding tab paragraphText">
                We are a team of four underclassmen from Tufts University who are passionate about computer science and the environment. 
                According to <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2020/07/23/science-study-shows-that-nearly-80-percent-of-the-annual-plastic-flow-into-the-environment"> Pew Charitable Trusts,</a> "More than 29 million metric tons of plastic enters the environment each year," harming "more than 800 species" and creating an economic cost on the industries of "fishing, tourism, and shipping" of "at least $13 billion annually."
                According to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/impacts-mismanaged-trash">EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)</a>, "Trash, packaging, and improperly disposed waste from sources on land accounts for 80% of the marine debris found on beaches during cleanups and surveys." 
                They also say that one of the best ways to have a large impact on the amount of trash entering the ocean is to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/what-you-can-do">organize community litter cleanups</a><div class=""></div>
            </div>
            <div class="middlePadding tab paragraphText">
                We started this project because we wanted to create a tool that would allow community leaders and legislators to have accurate community-reported data on where litter was located, and to reach large groups of volunteers to help with cleanups.
                By efficiently concentrating our litter into well-engineered and regulated landfills, we can protect local wildlife, clean watersheds, and make the world a better place to live in.
                With the data that could be collected using this webapp, regulators could also better understand which areas are most impacted by pollution, where to place community trash collection bins, and whether more community education is needed.
